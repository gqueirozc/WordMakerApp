# Desktop Executables

This folder contains the two executables for the windows form and API projects.
It is just a compiled version of the code existing in the repository if you desire not to download the full code repository.
The DLLs are in the 'dlls' folder with both original .exe files.

The WordMakerAPI shortcut initializes the API without the swaggerhub interface. This API is necessary for the mobile APP to work properly.
The WordMakerDashboard is the windows form app with the CRUD operations. The API is not necessary for this APP to work properly and can be run separetely.

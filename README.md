# WordMakerApp
This repository contains two different project solutions in two different folders.
 

## WindowsDashboard+API
 In this folder there will be a Visual Studio 2022 solution with two projects that run on the desktop app.

- The first one is a 'Windows Form App' made with .NET Framework 4.7.2 that serves as a 'Dashboard' with CRUD commands and visualization that connects with a PostgreSQL database online. Its executable will also be in the folder.

- The second solution is a Web API made with .NET 6.0 that fetches information from the database and updates it if necessary, this API is used for communication with the mobile application.


## MobileApplication
 In this folder there will be a Dart/Flutter solution for the mobile application that needs to use the API from the desktop app so it can communicate and work as expected. In this folder is the .apk installer for the app, and a video demonstration of it working.
